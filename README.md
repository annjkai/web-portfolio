# web-portfolio
This repository is a storage space for iterations of my personal portfolio page as I quest to make it more responsive. I'm currently using no JavaScript, only HTML5 and CSS3.

The page uses a Bootstrap4 framework (https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) which gave me lots to learn and fight with, as I found the grid system to not be as intuitive under certain circumstances. On the other hand, it was extremely useful to experience what Bootstrap does well and where it falls short.

I'm still struggling with the responsiveness of this web app as well as its cross-browser compatibility.
